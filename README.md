![UML Diagram](doc/uml.png)

1. In our UML diagram, should Task be a class or should it simply be a string?  Why or why not?
   - Task should be a class, so that it is more easily extensible in the future.
1. What future enhancements might you add to this project next?  Does the answer to this question change your answer to the first question?
   - We would consider adding subtasks, milestones, and due dates to improve organization. This does not change our answer to the first question, but rather reinforces it.
